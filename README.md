Tutorial-1--Build-Conway-s-Game-of-Life--Without-Visualization-
===============================================================

In this tutorial we will build a basic version of Conway's Game of Life, a simple two-dimensional cellular automata. The simulation will run from the command line and will not be visualizable (that's Tutorial 2) so you'll have to take it on faith that it runs properly.
This tutorial teaches:

	* How to build a basic simulation, use the random number generator, use the schedule (the representation of time), and schedule agents.
	* How to add a basic field (an object neighborhood, or representation of space) to the simulation.
	* How to make an agent
